Yes, this is a fork of a fork.  :)
I updated to use current XCode and Mac OS formats (OS 10.15 and XCode 11.4).  Mostly I wanted this to run on my current machine, which the original fork could not.

I am trying to decide if I could / should rewrite this using Metal.  I have never had a reason to use Metal before, and this could be a fun little project.  Please let me know if you would like to see this updated.
